        <h2>About Mongol-Tori</h2>
        <div class="text_box">
          <p>Mongol Tori is a next-generation Mars rover that will one day work alongside human explorers on
            the red planet. Mongol Tori was specifically made for the purpose of competing at the prestigious
            Mars rover competition known as the URC – University Rover Challenge. Apart from URC, Mongol
            Tori has also participated in the IRC – Indian Rover challenge which is another Mars rover
            competition annually organized in India. Mongol Tori is a Mars Rover that has been built to assist
            astronauts in space missions. Mongol Tori has the ability to retrieve objects, complete autonomous
            traversal missions, and collect visual data, perform planetary analysis, detect the presence of life by
            conducting biosignature tests and help astronauts with equipment servicing.</p>

          <p>One of our mains goals is to continue  participating in international events like URC and continue representing our
          country and wave its flag every time we go there. Team Mongol-Tori also aims to implement the aqured knowledge and technology in the development of Bangladesh. Mongol Tori has always enabled its members to excel
          through innovation, push limits, show dedication, and sportsmanship towards the team. We want to
          keep this up and we want our members to develop themselves further so that they can go on to teach
          the junior members through their skills and experience and the juniors, in turn, can teach their next
          generation and continue the legacy.</p>
